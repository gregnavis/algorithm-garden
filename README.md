Algorithm Garden
================

This repository contains algorithms of all sort implemented in C. The goal of
the project is to learn and understand the details of the algorithms. I won't
produce production-quality library code here. However one of my goals is to
produce code that is free of undefined behaviour.

Feel free to suggest an algorithm to implement!

Usage
-----

Clone the repository and issue `docco algorithm-garden.c`. The output is placed
in the `docs` subdirectory. Happy reading!

Sorting
-------

The algorithms that are currently implemented are:

  * selection sort
  * insertion sort
  * bubble sort
  * heapsort
  * quicksort
  * counting sort
  * radix sort

Number theory
-------------

  * powers modulo an integer
  * iterative and recursive Euclidean algorithm
  * least common multiple
  * Fermat primarility test

Binary trees
------------

  * pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal
  * tree size
  * tree height
  * equality testing

Binary search trees
-------------------

  * checking the binary search tree condition
  * finding an element in a binary search tree
